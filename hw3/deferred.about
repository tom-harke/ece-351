At one point my design was pushing duplicates onto the design.
So PUSH_IMMEDIATE 2 would transform
	stack
to
	2:2:stack

Roy's example program didn't catch the problem, since it consumed data immediately after each push.
This program pushes all the arguments to 5! onto the stack before it begins calculations.
